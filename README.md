# LaTeX, tutorial and templates on how to get started

The goal of this project is to condense my accumulated LaTeX code snippets into a short and comprehensible introduction for beginners.

Open the file "LaTeX-presentation.pptx" and follow instructions to set up your LaTeX environment.

Check out the LaTeX-template for your learning-by-doing experience ;-)
